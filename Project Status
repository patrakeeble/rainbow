Domain status- what does the business want as a business domain name?
- Preferably something like Rainbow RDA or Rainbow Riding for the Disabled. However we welcome recommendations!

There are 2 business branches, the school and the disabled school ? 2 different pages? ie 1 domain 2 pages?
- The website is back on line

What's the charity number? we need to review what's already out n the web
- Charity No.1174846

There is a proposal for using CPanel - when can this be finalised? we can have a sandbox and not yet push the page live.

Who is the 'decider' at Rainbow as to what goes ahead - we have Laura as a contact, but who does she report to for this purpose.  Trustee? Someone else?
- Decisions are made by the Rainbow RDA Committee, which currently consists of 6 members (Rexy,(chair), Roybyn(Fundraising), Barbra, Heather).Four of are trustees(me,Rexy,Robyn,Caroline). Projects may have elements which require committeee or trusty approval. Approval can be made quite quickly as we are in touch f-f, email and messenger.

There is lots of scope, but we need buy-in as we go along.  Should we be thinking of starting small but with proposed enhancements so they can choose priorities
-Starting small is a good idea. The main thing is to keep it as simple for us to update as posssible!! It will be mainly myself updating (Robyn, Rexy) if im not available).
We tend to use facebook for updates, but would love to be able to this on a website too.Ideally we would like the following sort of featdure on our website too.
Ideally we would like the following features on our website - but would love your suggestions too!
--Intro Page (we would like to provide the text)
--Our policies eg safeguarding, health and safety, insurance.esf
--List our sponsors, etc (eg list businesses that support us, their logo and link to their website)
--Make enquiries if possible - we do have a fosrm that needs to be completed for the new riders, but this could be something we need to add a later stage as big data collected from the form.
--Pricing and lessson dates/times (subject to change)
-- Event/Calendar(linked to facebook?)
--Newsletter,/Updates (we'd like to start a quaterly newsletter, which we can publish on the website and email to volenteers/riders careers and school, etc)
--Page to donate money? perhaps sponsoring a pony or donating to something in particular?
--Contact Us

Laura says she wants to maintain it - how much time would she (realistically!) have.  If she is already too busy, should we be thinking of a mostly static webpage with updates only being posted on Facebook
-To start with somthing static would be good - but would love your advice on that. To be able to link to facebook is important as we want to avoid as mnuch duplication of effort as poss.

(could have a Facebook page on webpage so it is easy to see - see rcas.org.uk for an example of what I mean)

Do you want help pulling together content for the site?What experience do they have?

Before we get too far with design, can we run an rough draft past them - in my limited experience of such things, the people say 'yes' to suggestions via email but as soon as they see
it mocked up they come back with lots of comments - maybe engages the brain differently.
What is housestyle - can we see examples of literature
